blogBlockQuote = I am the computer guy with varying fields of interests. From the technical perspective, I work on Java, databases, HTML, CSS, JavaScripts. From the non-technical perspective, I am interested in scientific developments, history, geography, maps, politics, international affairs, and many more. This is an attempt to showcase my understanding, point of view and learn things which I do not know. The reason behind this effort is to just claim a tiny place in this vast universe of information.
